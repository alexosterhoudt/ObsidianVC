# [[Dexterity]]
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

# [[Strength]]
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

# [[Constitution]]
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

# [[Intelligence]]
Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

# [[Wisdom]]
Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

# [[Charisma]]
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

# [[Advantage and Disadvantage]]
Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an [ability check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_4), a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.  
  
If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.  
  
If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.  
  
When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the [halfling’s Lucky trait](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Halfling?expansion=34047#toc_1), lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.  
  
You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, [actions](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_20), or [spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_2). [Inspiration](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Character%20Advancement#toc_17) can also give a character advantage. The  
GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

# [[Proficiency Bonus]]
Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on [ability checks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_4), saving throws, and attack rolls.  
  
Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.  
  
Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the [rogue’s](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rogue?expansion=34047#content) [Expertise](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rogue?expansion=34047#toc_4) feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain [ability checks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_4). If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.  
  
By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make [Intelligence (History) checks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_27).  
  
In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

# [[Contests]]
Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal— for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of [ability check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_4), called a contest.  
  
Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.  
  
If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

# [[Skills]]
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be [proficient](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_3) in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)  
  
For example, a [Dexterity check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_18) might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and [hiding](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_22).  
  
The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to [Constitution](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_23).) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an [ability check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_4) using a specific skill—for example, “Make a [Wisdom (Perception) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_30).” At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.  
  
For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a [Strength (Athletics) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_13). If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.  
  

### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities

Normally, your [proficiency](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_3) in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to [Strength checks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_13). In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a [Constitution check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_24) to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a [Strength (Athletics) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_13). Similarly, when your [half-orc](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Half-Orc?expansion=34047#content) [barbarian](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Barbarian?expansion=34047#content) uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a [Strength (Intimidation) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_13), even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.  
  

### Passive Checks

A passive check is a special kind of [ability check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_4) that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.  
  
Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:  
10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check  
  
If the character has [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_2) on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.  
  
For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and [proficiency](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_3) in Perception, he or she has a passive [Wisdom (Perception)](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_30) score of 14.  
  
The rules on [hiding](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_22) in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.  
  

### Working Together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an [ability check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_4) with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the [Help action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_26).  
  
A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires [proficiency](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_3) with [thieves’ tools](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Tools?expansion=34047#content), so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.  
  

### Group Checks

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.  
  
To make a group [ability check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_4), everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.  
Otherwise, the group fails.  
  
Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group [Wisdom (Survival) check](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_30) to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

# [[Lifting and Carrying]]
Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.  
  
**Carrying Capacity**. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.  
  
**Push, Drag, or Lift**. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.  
  
**Size and Strength**. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each [size](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_18) category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
