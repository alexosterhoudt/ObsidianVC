The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, old Phandalin was a thriving town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver Pact. However, the same bandits who sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave attacked the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.

In the last three or four years, hardy folk from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun settling atop the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier town has developed on the site of the old settlement. It’s home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few ruffians and bandits have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has been hounding Phandalin, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk only as “Glasstaff.” ![[02-001.ch2-splash.jpg|relative wmed|right lp]]

## Running this Chapter

In this chapter, the characters meet important townspeople who become their quest givers and friends throughout the adventure. By the time the mind flayer fanatics’ plot against Phandalin becomes clear in later chapters, the characters’ attachment to one or more NPCs in town should encourage them to save it. For now, consider portraying the townsfolk as friendly and curious about the adventurers to encourage these ties.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be 2nd level when the chapter begins. The characters gain a level when they finish exploring the Redbrand hideout under Tresendar Manor. 

## Welcome to Phandalin

When the characters first arrive in Phandalin, read the following:

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins—crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars—surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.

As you approach, you see children playing on the town green, and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at the shops in town. Many people look up and smile as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.

The characters can visit various locations in Phandalin and talk to the townsfolk.

When he hired the characters, Gundren Rockseeker provided an overview of the town and its locations to them. If the characters are using different adventure hooks, other people have told the characters about the town. Either way, the characters should have a rudimentary understanding of Phandalin’s layout.

At this point, show the players map 2.1. The characters arrive at Phandalin in the evening, so they have time to visit a few places before they must seek lodging for the night.

Some locales the characters could visit include the following:

**Barthen’s Provisions.** If the characters have the wagonload of supplies from the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, they’re meant to deliver it to this shop.

**Lionshield Coster.** If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.

**Stonehill Inn.** If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill Inn appears to be the best available option.
