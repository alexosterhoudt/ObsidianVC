The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, old Phandalin was a thriving town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver Pact. However, the same bandits who sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave attacked the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.

In the last three or four years, hardy folk from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun settling atop the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier town has developed on the site of the old settlement. It’s home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few ruffians and bandits have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has been hounding Phandalin, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk only as “Glasstaff.” ![[02-001.ch2-splash.jpg|relative wmed|right lp]]

## Running this Chapter

In this chapter, the characters meet important townspeople who become their quest givers and friends throughout the adventure. By the time the mind flayer fanatics’ plot against Phandalin becomes clear in later chapters, the characters’ attachment to one or more NPCs in town should encourage them to save it. For now, consider portraying the townsfolk as friendly and curious about the adventurers to encourage these ties.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be 2nd level when the chapter begins. The characters gain a level when they finish exploring the Redbrand hideout under Tresendar Manor. 

## Welcome to Phandalin

When the characters first arrive in Phandalin, read the following:

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins—crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars—surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.

As you approach, you see children playing on the town green, and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at the shops in town. Many people look up and smile as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.

The characters can visit various locations in Phandalin and talk to the townsfolk.

When he hired the characters, Gundren Rockseeker provided an overview of the town and its locations to them. If the characters are using different adventure hooks, other people have told the characters about the town. Either way, the characters should have a rudimentary understanding of Phandalin’s layout.

At this point, show the players map 2.1. The characters arrive at Phandalin in the evening, so they have time to visit a few places before they must seek lodging for the night.

Some locales the characters could visit include the following:

**Barthen’s Provisions.** If the characters have the wagonload of supplies from the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, they’re meant to deliver it to this shop.

**Lionshield Coster.** If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.

**Stonehill Inn.** If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill Inn appears to be the best available option.

## Encounters in Phandalin

If the players aren’t sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs can direct the characters toward various adventure opportunities and important rumors that can be found in other parts of the town.

### Redbrand Ruffians Appear

You can decide when the characters run into the Redbrands, the criminal gang that runs Phandalin. After the characters have visited several locations in town and talked to the townsfolk, they might decide to confront the Redbrands. When they do, run the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter. Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them at a time of your choosing.

### Finding Cragmaw Castle

The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to rescue Gundren Rockseeker. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, however, and no one in town knows the exact location of Cragmaw Castle; however, Qelline Alderleaf and Sildar Hallwinter can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who knows the location.

### Strange Goblins

The characters might be intrigued about the strange goblins with elongated skulls who wield green energy. Although the townspeople are focused on their troubles with the Redbrands, some disclose odd run-ins with the strange goblins. Descriptions of these run-ins appear in later sections.

### Important NPCs

The Phandalin NPCs table summarizes the most important NPCs in Phandalin and their relevance to the adventure. Unless otherwise noted, these NPCs are human and use the commoner stat block.

#### Phandalin NPCs
|Name|Relevant Information|
|---|---|
|Qelline Alderleaf|Helpful halfling farmer whose son, Carp, knows a secret way into the Redbrands’ hideout|
|Elmina Barthen|Owns a trading post and owes money to the characters|
|Daran Edermath|Drow member of the Order of the Gauntlet who has a quest for the party|
|Sister Garaele|Elf cleric of Tymora and Harper agent who has a quest for the party|
|Linene Graywind|Runs a trading post and offers a reward for retrieving her supplies|
|Sildar Hallwinter|Member of the Lords’ Alliance who has two quests for the party|
|Toblen Stonehill|Local innkeeper|
|Halia Thornton|Member of the Zhentarim who has a quest for the party|
|Harbin Wester|Townmaster of Phandalin who has a quest for the party|
## Town Description

Phandalin is small, so the characters can visit multiple locations and NPCs throughout a day. If the players choose to split up their characters, they can cover more ground, but splitting the party makes the “[Redbrand Ruffians](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#RedbrandRuffians)” encounter potentially more dangerous.

The following sections detail specific locations in town, as shown on map 2.1.

![[map-2.01-Phandalin.png]]
### Stonehill Inn

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> In the center of town, opposite the town green, stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.

The Stonehill Inn has five of its six rooms free (Sildar Hallwinter occupies the sixth room). Should the characters need more space or want to stay elsewhere, they can camp outside town, or they can persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.

The inn’s proprietor is a friendly young human man named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen doesn’t like the Redbrands at all, though he tries not to make trouble for fear that they might retaliate against his wife and children.

#### Rumors

Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with several good leads to explore in and around town. NPCs present in the Stonehill Inn and the rumors they pass on include the following:

**Elsa**, a dwarf bartender: “Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer.” (See the “Edermath Orchard” section for more information.) Elsa also brags about her sister, Gwyn, who is a scholar in the city of Neverwinter. Gwyn arrives in town shortly after the characters and becomes a major NPC in later chapters.

**Freda**, a gnome weaver: “The Redbrands hassle every business in town, except for the Phandalin Miner’s Exchange. They don’t want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it.” (See the “Phandalin Miner’s Exchange” section for more information.)

**Lanar**, a human miner: “Marauders have been attacking trade caravans on the east end of Triboar Trail. The townmaster is looking for someone to run them off. I think goblins are working with the marauders, too!” (See the “Townmaster’s Hall” section for more information.)

**Narth**, a human farmer: “Sister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded.” (See the “Shrine of Luck” section for more information.)

**Pip**, Toblen’s son: “Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but the Redbrands almost caught him! He also saw weird goblins hanging around!” (Carp is Qelline Alderleaf’s son. See the “Alderleaf Farm” section for more information.)

**Toblen**, the human innkeeper: “Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to the Redbrands a tenday ago when they came by his shop and bullied his wife. The ruffians provoked a fight and murdered Thel. Several townsfolk saw it happen. The Redbrands grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing.” (The Redbrands took the family to their secret hideout; see the “Redbrands’ Hideout” section.)

In addition, any NPC at the inn can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town.

### Barthen’s Provisions

Barthen’s Provisions is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. It stocks most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen’s doesn’t stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, except for items that cost more than 25 gp. Characters who ask for weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster (see [below](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#LionshieldCoster)).

The proprietor is Elmina Barthen, a young human woman with a kindly manner. She employs a couple of clerks, Ander and Thistle, who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Elmina isn’t around.

#### Delivery

If the characters began play with the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, their orders are to deliver the wagon of supplies to Barthen’s. Elmina pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character) and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If the characters tell her of Gundren Rockseeker’s capture, Elmina encourages the party to rescue the dwarf. She considers Gundren a friend and was excited by his talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver Pact in the nearby hills. If the party hasn’t already learned details of the mine from Sildar Hallwinter, a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (History) check can relate the information from the first two paragraphs of chapter 1.

Elmina also mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town. Elmina hasn’t seen them in a tenday and expects the brothers to return “any day now” to resupply. What Elmina doesn’t know is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine. (See chapter 4 for more information.)

#### Elmina’s News

If the characters ask Elmina for news of the town, the shopkeeper reluctantly admits that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down local businesses and flouting the townmaster’s authority. She knows that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house.

### Edermath Orchard

Daran Edermath is a retired drow adventurer. He lives in a tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard that grew wild long ago, and he is working to clear out the underbrush and cultivate the orchard again. Daran is well over five hundred years old, and he has worked as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the south. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.

Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a group of faithful seekers of justice who protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he’s no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He’s happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.

![[02-003.order-of-the-gauntlet-pin.png|wmed | left lp]]

#### Daran’s Suspicions

Daran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of heroes teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it’s time someone took a stand against their leader, whom the outlaws refer to as “Glasstaff.” He knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the Redbrands’ safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town. (See the “Tresendar Manor” section for more information.)

#### Old Owl Trouble

Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging in the ruins known as Old Owl Well. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by foul undead. He asks the characters to head to the ruins, a couple of days’ march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who’s there and what they’re doing. Daran knows the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the characters can ensure that no threat to the town is brewing at Old Owl Well, Daran is willing to give them his boots of striding and springing. The magical boots came in handy when Daran adventured, but he no longer needs them. If the party pursues this quest, see “Old Owl Well” in chapter 3.

> [!info]+ JOINING THE ORDER OF THE GAUNTLET
> If the party deals with the Redbrands and investigates the Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the Order of the Gauntlet. He speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the order, such as honor, vigilance, and righteous zeal. If a character agrees, Daran awards the individual the title of “Chevall” and hands them a pin that represents the order. This rank and faction won’t affect this adventure, but it’s significant for players who participate in Organized Play events.

### Lionshield Coster

![[02-002.linene-graywind.png|relative wmed|right lp]] A wooden sign shaped like a shield and painted with a blue lion hangs above the door of this trading post. The building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hit hard by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)

The owner of the Phandalin post is a human woman named Linene Graywind. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn’t know who is responsible.

In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale. Linene worries about Phandalin’s safety, however, and won’t sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town.

#### Recovered Goods

If the characters return the stolen goods recovered in area H8 of the Cragmaw hideout (or if they left the goods but reveal where they can be found), Linene offers a reward of 50 gp and promises to help the adventurers any way she can. She warns the characters that the Redbrands are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house.

### Phandalin Miner’s Exchange

The Miner’s Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. There isn’t any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.

The guild master is a quick-witted and ruthless human woman named Halia Thornton. In her attempts to establish the Miner’s Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working to slowly bring Phandalin under her control, and she can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don’t cross her.

![[02-004.zhentarim-pin 1.png|relative wtiny|left lp]]

#### Halia’s Job Offer

If the characters ask about the Redbrands, Halia describes how the ruffians loiter around the Sleeping Giant tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. She then offers the characters 100 gp to capture the Redbrands’ leader, whom the outlaws call “Glasstaff,” and bring her any correspondence found in his quarters.

The characters are wise to be cautious when dealing with Halia. She doesn’t reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrands herself. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates Halia has ulterior motives for removing the Redbrands’ leader.

Further, in chapter 4, Halia smuggles Nezznar the Spider out of town and into the Zhentarim’s custody, allowing the villain to escape justice.

> [!info]+ JOINING THE ZHENTARIM
> If the party dispatches the Redbrands’ leader, Halia Thornton converses with the characters to determine if any are candidates for membership in the Zhentarim. She is looking for people focused on wealth, power, and influence. If any characters meet her approval, she privately urges them to join the Zhentarim. Even if the party wipes out the entire Redbrand gang, Halia may still extend the offer in an effort to gain powerful friends (and spies) within the party. If a character agrees, Halia gives the individual the title of “Fang” and hands them a pin that represents the Zhentarim. This title and faction won’t affect this adventure, but it is significant for players who participate in Organized Play events.

### Alderleaf Farm

Qelline Alderleaf is a wise and pragmatic halfling farmer who seems to know everything that goes on in town. She is a kind host and is willing to let the characters stay in her hayloft if they don’t want to stay at the Stonehill Inn.

#### Carp’s Story

Qelline’s son, Carp, is a spirited and precocious halfling lad enchanted by the idea of being an adventurer. He was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of “big scary bandits” came out of the tunnel when he was there and met with a pair of Redbrands. They didn’t see him, but it was close. Carp thinks the bandits have a secret lair under the old manor house. He also saw some strange goblins with “glowing hands” duck into the tunnel. Carp can take the characters to the tunnel if asked, or he can give them directions to the location. The cave leads to area R8 in the Redbrands’ hideout.

#### Finding Cragmaw Castle

Qelline is a longtime friend of a druid named Reidoth. If Qelline realizes the characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such as Cragmaw Castle, she suggests the characters visit Reidoth and ask for her help, “since there’s not an inch of the land the druid doesn’t know.” Qelline tells the characters Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called Thundertree, just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and Qelline provides directions so the characters can easily find the place. If the party pursues this quest, see “Ruins of Thundertree” in chapter 3.

### Shrine of Luck

Phandalin’s only temple, this small shrine is made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, the god of luck and good fortune.

The shrine is in the care of a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a zealous young elf who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands and other evil influences. Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout Faerûn to thwart tyrants and despots. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.

![[02-005.harpers-pin.png|relative wtiny|left lp]]

#### Sister Garaele’s Bargain

Recently, Garaele’s superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission. They wanted to persuade a dangerous banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele underestimated Agatha’s wrath when she attempted to approach the banshee.

Before she fled for her life, Garaele noted that the banshee spoke wistfully about the beautiful baubles she owned in life. Garaele needs an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift—a jeweled silver comb—and persuade the banshee to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who pays obeisance to Agatha might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the mission to the characters and will give them three potions of healing as payment for their efforts. If the party pursues this quest, see “Conyberry and Agatha’s Lair” in chapter 3.

> [!info]+ JOINING THE HARPERS
> If the party helps Sister Garaele and learns from Agatha the fate of Bowgentle’s spellbook, Garaele privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the Harpers. She speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the network and possess a desire to enact positive change by gathering intelligence. If a character agrees, Garaele awards the individual the title of “Watcher” and hands them a pin to represent the Harpers. This rank and faction won’t affect this adventure, but it is significant for players who participate in Organized Play events.

### Sleeping Giant

This run-down tap house is a dirty, dangerous watering hole at the end of Phandalin’s main street. It is frequented by Redbrands and operated by a surly orc named Greska. If the characters choose to visit the place, see the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter.

### Townmaster’s Hall

![[02-006.harbin-wester.png|relative wmed|right lp]] Phandalin has no functioning government, but the village elects a “townmaster” each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps important records. The current townmaster is a human banker named Harbin Wester, a cheerful and well-liked, but timid leader. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, Harbin initially claims that they’re “just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really.”

The townmaster’s hall has a small but serviceable jail with two cells. Harbin eventually admits to the characters that the Redbrands should be captured so they can stand trial and potentially be sent to Neverwinter for imprisonment.

#### Dangerous Trail

Harbin posts official notices on a board beside the door of the townmaster’s hall. He’s looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where marauders have attacked several caravans near Wyvern Tor. The most recent victims reported that at least one strange goblin accompanied the marauders, who consist of at least an ogre and some bugbears. Harbin is offering a 100 gp contract to any group that can drive the marauders and any goblin companions away. If the party pursues this quest, see “Wyvern Tor” in chapter 3.

#### Finding Cragmaw Castle

After recovering at the Stonehill Inn, Sildar Hallwinter establishes himself at the townmaster’s hall. As an agent of the Lords’ Alliance, his goal is to see Phandalin thrive and become prosperous. Therefore, he wants to find the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and help the Rockseeker brothers put it back into production.

Sildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party a 500 gp reward if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and defeat or drive off the band’s leader. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the Triboar Trail for more raiding parties (see the random encounters in chapter 3).

![[02-007.lords-alliance-pin.png|relative wtiny|left lp]]

#### Finding Iarno Albrek

Sildar learns that Iarno Albrek, a fellow member of the Lords’ Alliance, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno—or what’s left of him if he is dead. Sildar describes Iarno as “a short, dark-bearded human wizard in his thirties.”

In reality, Iarno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the pseudonym “Glasstaff” to conceal his true identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have Iarno captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno’s fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Redbrand threat.

> [!info]+ JOINING THE LORD'S ALLIANCE
> If the party eliminates the threat from Cragmaw Castle or uncovers Iarno’s treachery, Sildar Hallwinter privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Lords’ Alliance. He speaks with those who exemplify a commitment to protecting vulnerable folk. If a character agrees, Sildar Hallwinter awards the individual the title of “Cloak” and hands them a pin to represent the Lords’ Alliance. This rank and faction won’t affect this adventure, but it is significant for players who participate in Organized Play events.

### Tresendar Manor

More a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, but its cellars have been converted into a Redbrand stronghold. If the characters investigate this place, they find the entrance to the Redbrand hideout (described below).

## Redbrand Ruffians

![[02-008.redbrand-ruffians.png]]

Within a day or so of the adventurers’ arrival in Phandalin, a confrontation with the Redbrands becomes inevitable. This can happen in several different ways:

**Confront the Redbrands.** After speaking with a few NPCs in town, the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant.

**Investigate Tresendar Manor.** The characters decide to investigate Tresendar Manor. Skip the encounter below and go straight to “Redbrands’ Hideout.”

**Redbrand Confrontation.** If the characters show no signs of going after the Redbrands, a gang of the ruffians seeks them out and picks a fight in the town streets. Run this encounter as the characters are leaving one of the locations in the town.

If the characters confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant, read:

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Several disheveled, surly humans linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks. Their stares are fixed on you as you approach.
> 
> One of the ruffians spits on the ground. “Well, well,” he says. “Here’s a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want here, puppies? Come down here to bark at us?”

If the Redbrands confront the characters in the street, read:

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> As you head into the street, you find several armed, surly humans waiting for you. Their scarlet cloaks are grimy, and they place their hands on their weapons as they watch you.
> 
> One of the ruffians spits on the ground. “You’ve been asking too many questions,” he snarls. “Time to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff and be on your way.”

Continue the baiting as long as you like. The Redbrands attack in a round or two if the characters don’t. Neither side is surprised because it’s obvious a fight is brewing.

Four Redbrand ruffians (see appendix A) fight the characters. The ruffians are not overly brave. If three of the Redbrands are defeated, the remaining ruffian flees toward Tresendar Manor.

### Development

Redbrands who are captured, persuaded, or charmed by the characters can impart useful information (see “What the Redbrands Know” below). The characters can easily convince Townmaster Harbin Wester to keep an eye on any prisoners they capture for at least a few days.

If the characters kill the ruffians, the townmaster expresses his fear of retaliation.

> [!tip]+ Are the Players Lost?
> After the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter, the players should realize it’s time to deal with the rest of the gang. If they aren’t clear that investigating the Redbrands’ hideout should be their next move, have one of the NPCs they’ve met in town ask the characters to investigate Tresendar Manor. However, if the players choose to avoid conflict with the Redbrands because they want to follow other leads in the area, it’s okay to move on to chapter 3 and let the ruffians wait. The next time the characters return to Phandalin, make it clear that the Redbrands are causing even more trouble and that they need to be dealt with. Some of the Redbrands may also bring the fight to the characters.

## Redbrands’ Hideout

The Redbrands’ base in Phandalin is a dungeon complex under Tresendar Manor. Before the manor was ruined, its cellars served as safe storage for food and water in the event that the estate was attacked, while an adjoining crypt provided a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands expanded the cellars to suit their own purposes, adding holding cells, workshops, and barracks.

If the characters begin their search at Tresendar Manor, they enter the hideout in area R1. If they instead follow Carp Alderleaf to the secret tunnel the lad found, they enter the hideout via area R8.

### General Features

The hideout consists of well-built chambers with flagstone floors and walls of dressed stone blocks. The western end of the complex is lower than the eastern end, with stairs leading down as the characters explore.

#### Ceilings

Passages and chambers are 10 feet high unless otherwise indicated.

#### Doors

All doors are made of wood with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. Doors are unlocked unless the text states otherwise. Glasstaff (area R12) and Nosk (area R9) each carry an iron key that locks and unlocks every door in the complex.

A locked door can be picked with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A door can also be broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Secret Doors

Secret doors are made of stone and blend into the surrounding walls. If an area contains one or more secret doors, a character searching the walls in that area finds its secret doors with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each search requires 1 minute.

Secret doors swing open on hidden iron hinges and are not locked.

#### Lights

Most areas are brightly lit by oil lamps in wall sconces, which are refilled every few hours as needed.

### What the Redbrands Know

If the characters charm or successfully question any of the Redbrands, they can learn the location of the main entrance to their hideout (area R1) as well as the following information:

**Glasstaff.** The leader of the Redbrands is a human wizard known as Glasstaff, so named because his magic staff is made of glass. (Only the Spider knows Glasstaff’s true identity as Iarno Albrek.) Glasstaff’s chambers are in the western end of the stronghold (see area R12).

**The Spider**. A mysterious figure called the Spider hired the Redbrands to frighten off adventurers and intimidate the locals, for reasons unknown. (The Spider wants to keep potential competition away from the Phandelver mine.) The Spider sent bugbears to reinforce the Redbrands and provide extra muscle (see area R9).

**Complex Guardian.** The lower part of the complex is guarded by a hideous “eye monster” (see area R8).

**Prisoners.** The Redbrands have a handful of captives in a holding area “near the old crypts,” which are guarded by skeletons (see area R4 for details).

### Redbrand Hideout Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.2.

![[map-2.02-Redbrand-Hideout.png]]
