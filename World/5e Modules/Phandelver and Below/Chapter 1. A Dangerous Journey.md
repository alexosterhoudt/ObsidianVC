More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge called the Forge of Spells, where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby town of Phandalin prospered as well. But disaster struck when bandits swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.

A powerful bandit force reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and knowledge of the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.

For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has located the lost mine. In recent years, people resettled the area, and Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town.

Recently, a trio of dwarves—the Rockseeker brothers—discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines. Unfortunately for the Rockseekers, they aren’t the only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain known as the Spider controls a network of bandit gangs and goblin bands in the area, and his agents followed the Rockseekers to their prize. The Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he’s taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter begins with a goblin ambush on the road to Phandalin, leaving it up to the characters to chase their attackers to a cave lair. Before getting into the adventure’s events, take a few minutes to do the following:

**Character Introductions.** Encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven’t done so already.

**Connection to Gundren.** Ask the players to think about how their characters came to know the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, if applicable. Let the players concoct their own stories. If a player is hard-pressed to think of anything, suggest something simple. For example, Gundren could be a childhood friend or someone who helped the player’s character escape a tough situation.

**Transportation Details.** Ask the players how their characters are traveling. If the characters are escorting Gundren’s wagonload of supplies, then one or two characters need to be driving the wagon. The rest of the characters can be riding on the wagon, walking alongside it, or scouting ahead.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be 1st level when the chapter begins. The characters gain a level when they finish exploring the Cragmaw hideout.

## The Road to Phandalin

The adventure assumes you’re using the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook (see this book’s introduction) for all your characters. The heroes are escorting a wagon full of provisions from Neverwinter to Phandalin. They’re a half-day’s march from Phandalin when they run into trouble with goblin raiders from the Cragmaw band.

Read the following text to get the adventure started. (If you’re using another adventure hook, skip to the second paragraph and adjust the details as necessary, ignoring the information about driving the cart.)

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> You began your adventuring career in the city of Neverwinter. A dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker hired you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days’ travel south of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found “something big,” and that he’d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen’s Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to “take care of business.”
> 
> You’ve spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you’ve just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail. You’ve had no trouble so far, but you know this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along this road.


### Driving the Wagon

Any character can drive a wagon, and no skill is necessary. Two oxen pull the wagon. If no one is holding the reins, the oxen stop where they are.

The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour; several casks of salted pork; two kegs of strong ale; shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each); and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp. 

### Goblin Ambush

Several hours after the characters turn onto Triboar Trail (shown on the map in the introduction), they reach the area shown on map 1.1.

![[map-1.01-Goblin-Ambush.png|relative wmed|left lp]] Read the boxed text below to start the encounter:

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> You’ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day and are nearing a side road leading south toward Phandalin. As you come around a bend, you stumble upon the scene of a recent battle. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side. Two horses wander the road, sniffing at ransacked personal effects.



The site is littered with arrows, torn scraps of fabric, and odds and ends discarded from Gundren’s bags when the goblins were looking for the map. If you’re using the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, any character who approaches the scene identifies the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. It’s up to the players to decide whether to bring the horses with them. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> The horses’ saddlebags have been looted. An empty leather map case lies nearby.



Four goblins are hiding in the woods, two on either side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the horses and then attack.

The goblins fight to the death until one goblin remains alive; that goblin then flees and heads for the goblin trail (see below).

#### Development

In the unlikely event that the goblins triumph, they leave the characters unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head to the Cragmaw hideout. The characters can continue to Phandalin, buy new gear at Barthen’s Provisions, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins’ trail, should they wish.

The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any weapon that deals bludgeoning damage (including an unarmed strike) to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. The goblin regains consciousness after a few minutes and can be convinced to share information (see “What the Cragmaws Know”). The goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout and to guide the party around the traps along the way (see “Goblin Trail” below).

The characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin. In that case, skip to chapter 2. Elmina Barthen (the owner of Barthen’s Provisions) seeks out the characters and informs them that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived. She recounts the goblin troubles and suggests the characters return to the ambush site to investigate further (after they rest). Barthen also tells the party that Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster (see “Town Description” in chapter 2) can provide more information on the goblin attacks.

![[01-002.cragmaw-goblin-ambush.jpg|relative wmed|right lp]]
### What the Cragmaws Know

Cragmaw goblins the characters capture can be persuaded to divulge the following information:

**Bugbear Leader.** Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg. Klarg reports to King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw band, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. (The goblins can provide basic directions to Cragmaw Castle. It’s about twenty miles northeast, in Neverwinter Wood.)

**Capturing Gundren.** Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named “the Spider” was paying the Cragmaws to capture Gundren Rockseeker and send him and anything he was carrying to King Grol. Klarg followed King Grol’s orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken with his personal effects—including a map—to King Grol.

**Sildar’s Location.** Gundren’s human companion is being held in the “eating cave” (area H6). About fifteen goblins currently dwell in this hideout.

**Strange Goblins.** Recently, strange goblins have sometimes joined the Cragmaws in their roadside ambushes, though not today. These strange goblins have elongated skulls, and glowing green energy surrounds their weapons when they attack. The Cragmaw goblins don’t know who these newcomers are; the new goblins simply cackle and leave after each attack. The Cragmaws are afraid of these strange goblins and think the characters should be, too. (This is a reference to the psionic goblins that factor more prominently in later chapters.)

### Goblin Trail

After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time.

On the north side of the road, characters can easily find a trail behind the thickets that leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail; the character also sees signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled from the ambush site.

The drivers can easily steer the wagon off the road and tie off the oxen before the characters pursue the goblins.

The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout (see below). Ask the players to determine the characters’ marching order as they follow the trail. The order is important because the goblins have set two traps along the trail to thwart pursuers.

#### Snare

About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, characters on the path encounter a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the snare. If the character fails the check, the snare triggers. The character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be flipped upside down and suspended 10 feet above the ground. The character has the restrained condition until 1 point of slashing damage is dealt to the snare’s cord. A character who isn’t lowered carefully takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

#### Pit Trap

After another 10 minutes traveling down the trail, the characters encounter a pit trap the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and triggers when a creature moves across it.

The character in the lead must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the character fails the check, they must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in the pit, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. The pit’s walls aren’t steep, so no ability check is required to scramble from the pit.

## Cragmaw Hideout

The Cragmaw goblins have established a hideout from which they can easily harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin. Their band is so named because members sharpen their teeth to jagged points to make them look fiercer.

The leader of the Cragmaws is a bugbear named Klarg, who has orders from King Grol to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.

The trail from the ambush site leads to the entrance of the Cragmaw hideout (area H1).

### General Features

The Cragmaw cave slopes steeply upward. The entrance is at the foot of a good-sized hill, and the caves and passages are inside the hill itself. ![[map-1.02-Cragmaw-Hideout.png|relative wmed|right lp]]

#### Ceilings

Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered chambers rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.

#### Light

Areas H1 and area H2 are outside. The rest of the cave complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source, such as a torch, a lantern, or a light spell.

#### Stalagmites

These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover.

#### Sound

The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren’t listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear activity in nearby chambers.

#### Stream

The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.

#### Rubble

Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain.

#### H1: Cave Mouth

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> The goblins’ trail ends at a cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows from the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets. A narrow, dry path leads into the cave on the right side of the stream.

The stream is 2 feet deep. It’s cold and slow, and not difficult to wade across. The thicket in area H2 is impenetrable from the west side of the stream.

_**Development.**_ The goblins in area H2 are supposed to be watching this area, but they aren’t paying attention. However, if the characters make a lot of noise here—for example, loudly arguing about what to do next, setting up camp, cutting down brush, and so on—the goblins in area H2 notice and attack them through the thicket, which provides three-quarters cover.

#### H2: Goblin Guard Post

When the characters cross to the east side of the stream, they can see around the screening thickets to area H2. This is a goblin guard post, though the goblins here are bored and inattentive.

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> On the east side of the stream that flows from the cave mouth, a small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form a lookout post. Wooden planks flatten the briars and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the area—including several goblins lurking there right now!

Two goblins and one goblin boss are stationed here. If the goblins notice intruders in area H1, they open fire with their bows, shooting through the thickets and probably catching the characters by surprise. If the goblins don’t notice the characters in area H1, they spot the characters splashing across the stream, and neither side is surprised.

Characters moving carefully or scouting ahead might be able to surprise the goblin lookouts. Have each character who moves ahead make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. The lowest check is the DC for the goblins’ Wisdom (Perception) checks to avoid being surprised.

_**Thickets.**_ The thickets around the clearing are difficult terrain, but they aren’t dangerous—just annoying. They provide three-quarters cover to creatures attacking through them.

_**Development.**_ When the goblin boss is defeated, any remaining goblins attempt to flee to area H3 and release the wolves there.

_**Treasure.**_ The goblin boss has a belt pouch containing 16 sp.

#### H3: Kennel

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps ascend to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end and is filled with the stench of animals. Three chained wolves snarl and rattle their chains as you approach the cave mouth. Each wolf’s chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.

The Cragmaws keep a kennel of foul-tempered wolves they’re training for battle.
![[01-003.cragmaw-wolf.png|relative wmed|right lp]]

Three wolves are chained to a single post. They can’t reach targets standing on the steps, but all three wolves attack any creature that moves into the room (see “Development” below). Goblins in nearby caves normally ignore the sounds of growling wolves, but if the characters fight the wolves, 1d4 goblins come to investigate in 2 rounds.

A character who tries to calm the animals can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a successful check, the wolves allow all the characters to move throughout the room. If the wolves are given food, the DC lowers to 10.

_**Fissure.**_ A narrow opening in the east wall leads to a natural chimney that climbs 30 feet to area H8. At the base of the fissure is rubbish that’s been discarded through the opening above. A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. On a check result of 6–9, the character struggles with the climb and takes 10 minutes to ascend or descend the shaft. On a result of 5 or less, the character gets a short way up or down the shaft before falling, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage before landing at the base of the shaft with the prone condition.

_**Development.**_ A goblin in this area can use an action to release one wolf from its chain.

If the wolves are goaded by enemies beyond their reach, they are driven into a frenzy. Each round that any character remains in sight, the wolves make a single DC 15 Strength check. On the first success, they loosen the iron rods securing their chains to the floor, and the DC drops to 10. On a second success, they yank the rods loose, bending the rods so their chains are freed. They then attack any intruders they can perceive.

#### H4: Steep Passage

From this point on, characters without darkvision will need a light source to see their surroundings.

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream.

Characters using a light source or darkvision can spot the rope bridge at area H5:

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rope bridge crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage 20 feet above the floor appears to intersect this one.

Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher and who can see the bridge in area H5 also notices a goblin guarding the bridge.

The goblin automatically notices the characters if they carry any light source or don’t use stealth as they approach the bridge. The goblin doesn’t attack, but instead attempts to sneak away to the east to inform their companions in area H7 to release a flood (see “Flood!” below). Any characters who can see the goblin and have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher notice the goblin’s movements.

_**Western Passage.**_ This passage is choked with rubble and blocked by steep slopes. Moving up the slope requires 5 feet of extra movement. Although this passage offers a way to avoid the goblin in area H5 or escape a flood, it’s more dangerous than it looks. A giant poisonous snake is coiled on the fragile ledge between the two escarpments. It strikes at any creature that disturbs it, which includes characters scrambling up the slope. A climbing character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher avoids being surprised. The snake has advantage on attack rolls against any character who fights while on the slope. A fight against the snake alerts the goblin on the bridge.

The ledge on which the snake is coiled is unstable. Vigorous motion can loosen the whole mass and send it tumbling to the east. Whenever a character on the ledge tries to move or make a melee attack in this space, that character must first succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or trigger a collapse. The triggering character, the snake, and any other creature in the eastern half of the disused passage must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from falling debris and falls with the prone condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

#### H5: Overpass

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> The stream continues beyond another set of uneven steps ahead, bending eastward. A waterfall burbles in a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you.

The goblins have set a bridge guard where a high tunnel passes through the larger cavern below. One goblin stands watch here and is well concealed, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot it. Like other goblins in the hideout, this guard is inattentive. If no characters are using light sources, any character can creep by without being noticed with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed check, the guard signals the goblins in area H7 to release a flood (see “Flood!” below), then uses a bow to shoot at the characters.

_**Rope Bridge.**_ This bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream. It’s possible to climb the cavern walls from the lower passage to the bridge. The walls are rough but slick, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb.

The rope bridge has AC 5 and 10 hit points, and it has vulnerability to fire and slashing damage. If the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to dart across the bridge safely. On a failed save, a creature falls, takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and has the prone condition.

_**Flood!**_ The large pools in area H7 have collapsible walls that can be yanked out of place to release a surge of water down the main passage of the lair. If the goblins in area H7 are warned about the approaching characters, they start knocking away the wall supports of one pool in the next round. In the following round on the goblins’ initiative count, water surges from area H7 to area H1.

When the flood happens, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!warning]+ FLOOD
> The passage fills with a mighty roar as a huge surge of rushing water pours from above!

The flood threatens all creatures in the tunnel. (The goblin on the bridge is out of danger, as are any characters who successfully climbed the cavern walls.) Any creature within 10 feet of the disused passage at area H4 or the steps leading to area H3 must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept away. A creature that fails the Dexterity saving throw must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw to hold on. A creature that fails the Strength saving throw is washed into area H1, takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage, and has the prone condition.

The goblins in area H7 can release a second flood by opening the second pool, but they don’t do this unless the goblin on the bridge tells them to. The goblin on the bridge waits to see if the first flood got rid of all the intruders before calling for the second flood to be released.

#### H6: Goblin Den

The Cragmaw raiders stationed in the hideout use this area as a common room and barracks. Any character who attempts to approach quietly must make a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check or be spotted by the goblins in the lower portion of the cave.

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep, natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins.

Five goblins and two goblin bosses inhabit this den. The southern half of the cave is 10 feet higher than the northern end.

**Sildar Hallwinter** is being held prisoner in this chamber. He is bound on the southern ledge of the cavern. The goblins have been beating and tormenting him, so he is weak and has 1 hit point.

One of the goblin bosses, Yeemik, is second-in-command of the hideout. If he thinks the characters are winning the battle, he grabs Sildar and drags him to the edge of the upper level. “Truce, or this human dies!” he shouts. The other goblin boss, Errk, shouts along supportively.

Yeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new leader. If the adventurers agree to parley, Yeemik tries to convince them to kill Klarg in area H8, promising to release Sildar when they bring back Klarg’s head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn’t trust the goblin, and he’s right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar after they complete their part of the bargain.

If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and continues fighting. Sildar takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage, dropping him to 0 hit points if he hasn’t received any healing. A character can help Sildar with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check, a healer’s kit, or magical healing.


![[01-004.sildar-hallwinter.png|relative wmed|left lp]] _**Roleplaying Sildar.**_ Sildar is a kindhearted human man of nearly fifty years who holds a place of honor in the famous griffon cavalry of Waterdeep. He is an agent of the Lords’ Alliance, a group of allied political powers along the Sword Coast concerned with mutual security and prosperity. The order ensures the safety of the cities and other settlements of Faerûn by proactively handling violent threats, and order members work to bring honor and glory to their leaders and their homeland.

Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accompany him to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the disappearance of Iarno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords’ Alliance, who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to Iarno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a center of wealth and prosperity.

Sildar provides the characters with the following useful information:

**A Missing Wizard.** Iarno Albrek, a human wizard, was Sildar’s contact in Phandalin. The wizard traveled to the town several months ago to try to establish order there. After the Lords’ Alliance didn’t hear from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.

**Wave Echo Cave**. The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of this chapter with the players at this time. The characters won’t know yet, but Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine.)

**The Mysterious Spider.** Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that “the Spider” sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn’t know who or what the Spider is.

**Finding Cragmaw Castle.** Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the leader of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn’t know where that might be but suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn’t occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle’s location. See “What the Cragmaws Know” section earlier in this chapter.)

**Strange Goblin.** A strange goblin with an elongated head was with the Cragmaw band that waylaid Sildar. The goblin gave Sildar a bad feeling, but the Cragmaws didn’t seem to know the creature. The goblin whispered “you’re not what Ruxithid wants” to Sildar before leaving the Cragmaw ambush group. (This is a reference to the psionic goblins that factor more prominently into later chapters.)

Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue to Phandalin, since it’s the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to escort him. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day of arriving in Phandalin. He hopes they’ll first put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.

_**Development.**_ If he is rescued and healed, Sildar remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn’t have any weapons or armor, but he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character. Sildar’s gear was taken to Cragmaw Castle.

_**Treasure.**_ One goblin boss, Errk, wears a belt pouch containing 21 cp. The other boss, Yeemik, carries a pouch containing three agates worth 10 gp each and a potion of healing.

#### H7: Twin Pools Cave

If the goblins have drained either pool to flood the passage, adjust the following boxed text accordingly:

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> This cavern is half-filled with two large pools of water. A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows from the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls serve as dams holding the water in. A wide exit stands to the south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear.

Three goblins and two wolves guard this cave. If the goblins were warned about the characters, the goblins here are on guard. As soon as a fight breaks out here, one of the goblins flees to area H8 to warn Klarg. Creatures in area H8 can’t hear fighting in this area due to a noisy waterfall, nor can creatures in this area hear fighting in area H8.

_**Rock Dams.**_ The goblins built these simple dams to control the flow of water through the heart of the complex. If a goblin from another area called for the goblins here to release a flood, one or both pools are mostly empty and the stream flows unimpeded.

![[01-005.klarg-et-al.png|relative wmed|right lp]] 
#### H8: Klarg’s Cave
The leader of the Cragmaw goblins insists on keeping the bulk of the raiders’ stolen goods in his den, which contains plunder from about 30 days of raiding and ambushing caravans.

> [!info]+ Read Aloud
> Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled in the south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. A larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, and the roar of falling water echoes from beyond. In the middle of the cavern, the coals of a large fire smolder.

Klarg the bugbear shares this cave with two goblins (his “honor guards”) and his mangy pet wolf, Ripper. The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty king just beginning his career of conquest. He refers to himself in the third person: “Who dares defy Klarg?” and “Klarg will build a throne from your bones!” The goblins under his command resent his incessant bullying.

_**Fire Pit.**_ The hot coals in the central fire pit deal 1 point of fire damage to any creature that enters the area, or 3 (1d6) fire damage to any creature that falls there with the prone condition. A creature can take the listed amount of damage only once per round.

_**Natural Chimney.**_ A niche in the western wall forms the top of a shaft that descends 30 feet to area H3. See that area for information on climbing the natural chimney.

_**Supplies.**_ The piles of sacks and crates provide half cover to any creature fighting or hiding behind them. Most are marked with the image of a blue lion—the symbol of the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company with a warehouse and trading post in Phandalin. Linene Graywind at the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin seeks these sacks and crates in the next chapter.

Hidden among the supplies is an unlocked treasure chest belonging to Klarg (see “Treasure” below). Any character who searches the supplies finds the chest.

_**Development.**_ If Klarg was warned that the hideout is under attack, he and his allies hide behind stalagmites or piles of supplies, hoping to ambush the characters when they enter the cave. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher isn’t surprised.

If Klarg and his allies were not warned about possible attackers, the characters can surprise them by climbing the chimney from area H3.

The goblins and the wolf fight to the death. If all Klarg’s allies are killed, the bugbear attempts to climb down the chimney to area H3 and flee the complex. However, he must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check to wriggle through the narrow opening to area H3. On a failed check, he has the restrained condition. He can use an action to make another DC 10 Dexterity check; a successful check ends the restrained condition on him.

_**Treasure.**_ The captured stores are bulky, and the characters will need a wagon to transport them. If they return the supplies to the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin (see chapter 2), they earn a reward of 50 gp and the friendship of Linene and her company.

In addition to the stolen provisions, Klarg has a treasure chest that contains 1,700 cp, 150 sp, two potions of healing, and a jade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes worth 40 gp. The frog statuette can fit in a pocket or pouch.

### What’s Next?

The next stage of the adventure takes place in Phandalin. The adventurers should have plenty of reasons to visit the town:

**Deliver Supplies.** If the characters began with the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, they can be paid by Barthen’s Provisions for delivering the wagonload of supplies.

**Escort Sildar.** If the characters rescued Sildar Hallwinter, the wounded warrior would appreciate an escort to Phandalin.

**Seek NPCs**. Other adventure hooks or background connections might prompt the characters to seek out specific NPCs in the town.

It’s also possible that players might decide to do something different, such as striking out in search of Cragmaw Castle. If that’s the case, skip to chapter 3.
